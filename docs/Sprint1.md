Create a basic navbar component to be displayed on top of pages.

> [Create static landing page using Angular](https://github.com/Djhranicky/ConcertTracker-SE-Project/issues/15):  
Develop a landing page to introduce users to the platform. For dynamic segments, static data using angular services were implemented as placeholders while backend is developed.

Develop low-fidelity wireframes to establish a basic UI structure for the platform.

> [Create Hi-Fi Wireframes](https://github.com/Djhranicky/ConcertTracker-SE-Project/issues/3):  
Develop high-fidelity wireframes using Figma to use as reference for frontend development.

> [Add database connection for backend](https://github.com/Djhranicky/ConcertTracker-SE-Project/issues/11):  
Set up a backend database to store user data. Planning on using GORM for scalability, and starting out with sqlite for prototyping.

 Add a route in the API to handle user login. This should verify the incoming JSON payload is valid, throw an error if incorrect credentials are given, and allow the user to log in if appropriate. Should follow REST API standards

> [Add register route](https://github.com/Djhranicky/ConcertTracker-SE-Project/issues/12):  
Add a route in the API to handle user registration. This should verify the incoming JSON payload is valid, throw an error if the user already exists, and create the user if appropriate. Should follow REST API standards

Implement a basic session manager that will track if a user is logged in appropriately.

## Which ones didn't and why?

- Did not address different user types (regular user/admin) since it was not part of core functionality for Sprint 1
- Hi-Fi Wireframes design was limited to the pages/features planned and assigned for this Sprint to prioritize resource availability to the full development life-cycle (research for implementation, development, testing) of the Sprint 1 pages over design completion of the pages needed for future sprints.
    - Access Hi-Fi Wireframes on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/UDZWqavzqChV4hzMGILRG8/concerto?node-id=3-948&t=MQ128j8LzTsLIlxL-1)
